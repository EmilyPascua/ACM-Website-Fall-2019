## To Run

`npm start`

## Development Procedures

Please follow these procedures to complete your assigned tasks, doing so will allow clean and easy-to-follow code changes! :)<br>

<u><b>Workflow</b></u>

Gitflow

<u><b>General Strategy</b></u>

<ul>
<li> You will be assigned an issue. These issues are usually labeled as "ACMW-XXXX".
<li> Once assigned an issue (by Emily) - create a branch <i>from develop (git checkout develop)</i> named that issue. (i.e., I am given the issue ACMW-0001, I create a branch named ACMW-0001 by using the command "git checkout -b ACMW-0001").
<li> Once you have completed your changes push your changes upstream (git push origin ACMW-XXXX). 
<li> Create a pull request against develop. <i>DO NOT MERGE YOUR CODE!</i>
<li> Add "EmilyPascua" as a reviewer (left hand corner). Add any comments if necessary.
<li> After Emily reviews your code, she will merge it into develop.
</ul>

Notes: Your branch won't be deleted after merging for documenting purposes. Emily will close the issue once code is merged.
  
Wa'lah!<br>

<u><b>Types of Tasks</b></u>

Not all tasks are for development, sometimes they are for fixing up bugs, adding documentation, or whatever. Here's how to differentiate. These can be found in the right hand side of the issue.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> A bug. These are usually high priority.
  <li> <b>Enchancement</b> These are features. Low priority and most likely "nice-to-haves".
  <li> <b>Documentation</b> ??? Idk if we may even use this.
</ul>
