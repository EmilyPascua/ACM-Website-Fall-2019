## To Run

`npm start`

## Development Procedures

Please follow these procedures to complete your assigned tasks, doing so will allow clean and easy-to-follow code changes! :)<br>

<b>General Strategy</b>

<ul>
<li> You will be assigned an issue. These issues are usually labeled as "ACMW-XXXX".
<li> Once assigned an issue (by Emily) - create a branch <i>from develop (git checkout develop)</i> named that issue. (i.e., I am given the issue ACMW-0001, I create a branch named ACMW-0001 by using the command "git checkout -b ACMW-0001).
<li> Once you have completed your changes push your changes upstream (git push origin ACMW-XXXX). 
<li> Create a pull request against develop. <i>DO NOT MERGE YOUR CODE!</i>
<li> Add "EmilyPascua" as a reviewer (left hand corner). Add any comments if necessary.
<li> After Emily reviews your code, she will merge it into develop.
</ul>
  
Wa'lah!
